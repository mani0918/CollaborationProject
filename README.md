# CollaborationProject
Hello there,

Welcome to my github. I am Manideep.

# Collaboration Website
 This a Collaboration website which is built using spring and hibernate which makes it database independent. It is divided into two parts frontend and backend which makes it scalable.
 
 It has a role based access mechanism i.e Student, Alumini, Employee and Admin. It is secured using AngularJS Security which satisfies all the modern security needs for a website.
 
 **Admin** - They will be able to approve or reject new, rejected blogs, create new or manage existing forums, create, close or reopen jobs and can manage job applications, create new users, manage existing or rejected users and can create a new user.
 
 **Student/Alumini/Employee**  -They will be able to view and add blogs, comment on forums, apply for jobs, can search for users to make friends or view their profile. Every user has a 'My Profile' tab where they can upload a new profile picture, manage existing friends, manage friend requests, manage sent friend requests and can also see the status of applied jobs.
 
 **New Users** - New users can register as Student, Alumini or Employee. Admin need to approve before the user can login. Admin can also modify user details such as Role and can make a student/alumini/emp as an admin if required but not password or userid.
 
 Blogs once posted by user need to be approved by admin before anyone can see them in blogs page.
 
 Local Storage and cookies are used to save the data and reload as required upon page reload. Local Storage is preferred over cookies considering limited 4k size of cookies.
